containers have to fulfill four major requirements to be acceptable as such:
Not negotiable: They have to run on a single host. Okay, so two computers cannot run a single container.
Clearly: They are groups of processes. You might know that Linux processes live inside a tree structure, so we can say containers must have a root process.
Okay: They need to be isolated, whatever this means in detail.
Not so clear: They have to fulfill common features. Features in general seem to change over time, so we have to point out what the most common features are.
